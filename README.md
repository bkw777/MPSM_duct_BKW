The model is highly parametric and uses the openscad customizer to adjust all kinds of things.  
Thre major options are:  
* fan size: 40mm, 35mm, 30mm
* screw holes sized for screwing directly into the plastic, or pockets for heat-set inserts


40mm fan  
You don't need a 40x20 like this. A silent noctua 40x10 would be plenty considering the original fan is only 30x10 and did both the heat break and the part cooling.  
I have retrofitted my hotend with a standard E3D V6 style heat sink, bimetal heat break, and Triangle Lab CHC ceramic heater cartridge, so it can run hotter than stock. So I wanted the extra hotend cooling to prevent heat creep.  
I drilled 4 more holes in the hotend carriage behind the heat sink to allow more air flow.  
(8 or 9mm, 1 vertical through top & bottom right between the bearings close to the rails, and one horizontal, adding 4 total 8-9mm holes behind the hotend).

35mm fan  
35mm is a less common size but they do exist and the hot-end duct on the printer happens to be 35mm wide by 34mm tall.

30mm fan  
The original fan is 30mm, so with this version you can just re-use the original fan, only this way it's dedicated 100% for the heat break.  
Aslo a standard E3D V6 only has a 30mm fan and they are perfectly effective.
